# RedisInsight: The best Redis GUI
Welcome to a new level of productivity when developing with Redis using the completely redesigned and open source RedisInsight 2.0 which provides an updated UI, browser tool, advanced CLI, custom data visualization, and built-in guides to help with using Redis data models like JSON and time series.

# Streamline your Redis application development
RedisInsight provides an intuitive Redis admin GUI and helps optimize your use of Redis in your applications. It supports Redis Open Source, Redis Stack, Redis Enterprise Software, Redis Enterprise Cloud, and Amazon ElastiCache. RedisInsight now incorporates a completely new tech stack based on the popular Electron framework. And it runs cross-platform, supported on Linux, Windows, and MacOS.

## RedisInsight
RedisInsight is a desktop manager that provides an intuitive and efficient GUI for Redis, allowing you to interact with your databases, monitor, and manage your data.

## Visualize and Interact with Redis databases
Scan existing keys, add new ones, and perform CRUD or bulk operations. Display objects in a pretty-print JSON objects format and support friendly keyboard navigation.

## Built-in support for Redis modules
Query, visualize, and interactively manipulate graphs, streams, and time-series data. Build queries, explore the results, optimize, and quickly iterate with a multi-line query editor. Support for JSON, Search, Graph, Streams, Time Series, and RedisGears.

## Memory analysis for Redis
Analyze memory usage offline—without affecting Redis performance—by key patterns, expiring keys, and advanced search to identify memory issues. Leverage recommendations to reduce memory usage.

## Trace Redis commands

Identify top keys, key patterns, and commands. Filter by client IP address, key, or command across all nodes of a cluster. Effectively debug Lua scripts.

## Intuitive CLI

When a GUI is not enough, our command-line interface, leveraging the Redis CLI, provides syntax highlighting and auto-complete and employs integrated help to deliver intuitive, in-the-moment assistance.

## Administer Redis

Gain insights into real-time performance metrics, inspect slow commands, and manage Redis configuration directly through the interface.
